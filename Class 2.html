					I am <b>Suraiya Nazneen</b> from Gaibandha.I have completed my graduation in <b style="font-size:35;padding:100px">Pharmacy</b> and done Masters in <b>Pharmaceutical Technology</b> from <i>University of Asia Pacific</i>.I was a Brand Executive-Human at the ACME Laboratories Ltd and later joined NOVO Healthcare Ltd and Ethical Drugs Ltd accordingly.<br>Personaly I am an extrovert person who loves to interact with others.There is a proverb saying <i>"tommorow is not promised to anyone"</i> but I believe tommorow can be changed by today's hardwork.I am now a full time homemaker and was searching something to utilize my leisure time.So I got interested in this training and fortunately had the chance to join the training on "Web Design and Web Development".<br>I am a quick learner and love to take challenges.This could be a small step to learn Web design and Web Development but I am eager to be successfull in this field.<i>Everything starts from zero hoping to be a grand Achievement one day</i>.So I am hoping that whatever I am learning from this training will help me create a new identity.
